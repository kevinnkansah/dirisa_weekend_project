Explore the data, visualize key patterns and predict people that are going to default on their loans and yeah train a model that can predict which users will default on loans and also they have to handle the imbalance in the dataset

This is an open ended project, feel free to apply your creativity, you may use the clean dataset or if you are up for a challange you can use the raw dataset

Goodluck!
